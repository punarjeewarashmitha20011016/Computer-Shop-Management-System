#Green Computers - Computer Shop Management System
_This is the final individual project which is implemented for a Computer Shop for managing their business process.
The technologies which I have used to implement this application are Java, Javafx, MySql, Jaspersoft.
This application handles the overall business processes. The business processes which is handled in this system are placing an order, placing a repair order, managing returns._
<br />
<br />
**Key Features in this application are,**
<br />
- Encrypting login details. This is done using my own algorithm using java without muSql queries.
- Displaying notifications in the interface. This is an uncommon function which cannot be seen in most of the javafx applications.
- Viewing Jasper report in an anchor pane. This is also an uncommon function which can be rarely seen.
- Auto suggestions of words - This function allows you to see some sort of keywords suggesting for searching.
- Usr can upload an image to his/her login details and can view that image when he/she logs into the system.
